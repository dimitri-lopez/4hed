** Origin of the Earth Video
Start at 6:08
Gravity collapsed creating the solar nebula
*** Gases formed
*** Dust grains of heavier elements closer to the sun
**** When they collide the grow in size
**** Pebbles -> Rocks -> Bigger Collisions
**** Head on collisions -> Explosions
**** Rocks sometimes stick together
***** Increases the gravity of the rocks
**** Gravity shapes them into planets
*** Early Earth
**** A fiery ball of magma
***** Really violent
***** Asteroid Belt
****** Enormous rocks leftover from planet building
****** Gets knocked out of orbit every once and a while
****** Called meteors
******* Contains clue to the beginning of Earth
******* Windows to the past
****** Carbon rich meteorite landed in Canada
******* Highest content of a
******* High water content
******* Allows the age of the meteorite to be determined
******** About 4.5 billion years old -> Initial age of the solar system
***** Earth struck my many meteors
***** Radioactive elements inside Earth producing more heat
***** Dense metals melted during this time
****** Magma ocean (liquid rock ocean)
****** Sinking iron sank towards the center of the Earth
****** Molten metals constantly moving
******* Turned our Earth into a magnet
******** The magnetic north pole moves constantly
** HW Formation of Earth Video
*** Black Stage
Earth is formed from meteorites and dust
Earth started orbiting the sun
Earth was hot and molten, cooled to balsaltic rock
Nothing survived
*** Grey Stage
Intense heat and pressure causes new materials to form
Granite becomes the foundation of our continents
Earth appearance from black -> Gray
**** Intense heat and pressure in the creation of our planets
**** No plants or animals
*** Blue Stage
**** Cool enough for water to form
**** Water is a great solvent
**** Water / oceans appeared
**** Zircon crystals found
**** Faint signs of life are found
***** Can only be formed in the prescence of water
*** Red Stage 3.5 BYA
**** Heavy atmosphere rich in N CO2 but no O2
**** Photosynthesis starts
**** Oceans are filled with iron, sunk to the bottom
**** Rock creates life <---> life cretes rocks
*** White Stage 540 MYA
**** Life nearly wiped out
**** Volcanoes caused carbon dioxide levels to rise, allowed life to survive
**** CO2 rises -> green house effect -> ice melts
**** These cycles happened multiple times
**** Deep freeze
*** Green Stage 520 MYA
Our living planet
**** Rise of oxygen
**** Microbes present
**** Oxygen allows life to proliferate
**** Life transform a planet
** How are stromatolites important?
*** They start to create oxygen
*** Fossils exist of them
*** Living stromatolites still exist
** How did life arise?
*** Video
**** Heavy elements are formed by stars
**** Stars make heavier elements
***** Starts out of hydrogen and helium 7:3
***** Hydrogen fusion creates energy
***** Helium fuses after hydrogen is exhausted
***** C N O and others start to form, in increasing heaviness
***** Iron can't be fused together -> star collapses
**** Star collapsing
***** Stupendous explosion
***** Supernova is formed
***** Fuses heavy elements together, without limit
*** Basic Elements and Basic Organic Compounds
**** Formation of the Elements in the Stars
*** Building blocks of life
**** Elements formed in the forge of stars
**** Carbon based molecules are brought to Earth by asteroids and comets
**** Early oceans were a chemical factory for rich array of organic molecules
*** Complex Biomolecules
**** Stanley Miller Experiments
***** Was RNA the original self-replicating molecule?
****** Ancient viruses uses RNA
****** RNA has diverse roles in modern cells
****** Only RNA can initiate DNA replication
****** RNA regulates gene expression
****** Ribosomes are made of RNA and proteins
******* Assembles proteins made of RNA and protein
******* RNA is the catalytic site for the peptide bond formation
**** Did DNA or Proteins come first?
***** DNA is needed in cells to make proteins
***** Proteins are needed to make DNA
***** Enzyme - proteins that catalyze reactions
***** Proteins were thuoght to be the only bio molecule to catalyze molecules
***** Catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) discovered
****** RNA replicases were found to catalyze their own synthesis
**** RNA World - Walter Gilbert
***** Starting genetic material
***** RNA used in early life forms
***** More stable molecules (DNA) came later
***** The RNA Enigma
*** Membrane Enclosure
**** Bilayers of phospholipids
***** Hydrophyllic head
***** 2 hydrophobic tails
***** Spontaneously forms two layered sheets
***** Hydrophyllic heads on the outside
***** Surrounds all living cells
***** Surrounds the nucleus and other cellular structure
**** Formation of the Protocell
Very first cell / precursor to modern cells.
***** RNA enters the cell and is a primitive type of DNA
***** Replicase is needed to replicate the RNA
*** Selection and Evolution Change
**** Protocells with a high amount of RNA outcompete other protocells
***** RNA must be replicases
**** Mutations occur causing better protocells
**** Merging of protocells brings capabilities to other cells
*** Zircons
**** Made up of zirconium silicate
**** Likely from magma that incorporated water
*** Emergent Properties of Living Organisms
When things are combined, new properties emerge. Usually can't be predicted.
**** Atoms formed
**** Atoms combine to form precursor molecules
**** Precursor molecules
**** Exists in living systems
***** A lot of humans form societies
**** Exists in nonliving systems as well
*** What is Life?
**** The ultimate emergent property
**** Erwin Shodinger
***** Laid foundations of molecular biology
***** Life could be understood of laws of physics and chemisty
**** Life constantly takes in from its environment
**** Smallest Lifeform has 182 genes (159,662 genes)
**** Number of genes is less in symbiotic organisms
*** Viruses
*** Requirements for Life
**** Cells
**** Homeostasis
**** Make / consume energy
**** Reproduce
**** Response
**** DNA - Hereditary Information
**** Grow / develop
**** Evolution
** Pre and Post Campbrian Evolution
** Cell Types over Time
*** Hadean Eon
**** Might have had protocells ~4 BYA
**** Prokaryotic bacteria ~3.8BYA
**** Anaerobic conditions
*** Archaea 3.7BYA
- Live in hostile environments.
- Wall structure allows them to live in hostile environments
***  Anaerobic Photo Synthesis 3.2BYA
No oxygen produced
Light used

Carry out photosynthesis over
Cyanobacteria (blue green algae)
North Pole
** Domains of Life
*** Common Ancestor

** Universal Features of Cellular Life
- Enclosed in membranes
- Hereditary information stored in membranes
- Replicate using DNA through the same way
- Use proteins as catalysts
- Utilize ATP
- 500 cellular metabolic reactions
- Most archae and bacteria have about 1,000 - 4,000 genes
** Photosynthesis and Oxygen
*** No oxygen at the start
*** Oxygen is highly reactive
*** Development of oxygenic / non cyclic photosynthesis led to slow increase of oxygen
*** Oxygen is present in iron formations
**** O2 levels slowly increased
**** When O2 reaches about 15% iron bands form
*** Discovery of Photosynthesis
**** Lit candle under the jar
**** Left a mint leaf under the jar for 10 days
**** Rejuvenated the air
**** Only works when in the sun
*** Chloroplasts
**** Chromosomes: circular DNA
**** Synthesize its own proteins
**** Ribsosomes present
**** Eukaryotic cells without chloroplasts can't make chloroplasts
**** Grows, divides, duplicates DNA
**** Thylakoid membanes are stacked
** Ediacrian Period
Shellless animals
Weird creatures on the sea floor
Absorbing nutrients from the sea floor
Disappear when Cambrina came around
** Cambrian Explosion
Explosion of new animals
Cause of the explosion is unknown
Trilobyte part of the explosion
Availability of oxygen holding back life
Organic carbon and oxygen gets created
Oxygen allows larger animals to live
Materials made from nutrients on the sea floor
Nervous systems develop
Vision developed - May have triggered the Cambrian explosion
Rise of predators
Brand new ecology forms
A large scale extinction may have come right before it
Homosapians are a result of the explosion

** Burgess Shale
Rick in fossils
125 genera were found in the shale
Over 100 then compared to about 30 now
All 26 phyla with hard body parts arose at the beginning of Cambrian

** Oxygen Importance
High oxygen reaches deep sea and then life arises
Large species were then allowed to evolve

** Link between Oceans -> Land
Tiktalik found
Part animal and part fish
Both lungs and gills
A predictable intermediate


Genetic building blocks needed
Oxygen needed
Ecological feedback (predator and prey)


** Snowball Earth
Reoccuring life ages
Encouraged oxygen / photosynthesis
